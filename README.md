# README: Dapper Servant

I love Jenkins, but find [the job configuration UI](https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/view/All/job/jenkins_main_trunk/configure)
to be terrible (at least as of version 1.5xx).

So I wrote some CSS overrides which make it a little easier to use, in my opintion, by doing simple things like
coloring the bottom sticky footer, indenting things better, and tweaking font sizes.

I use a GreaseMonkey script to apply the styling in order to avoid having to install a plugin on the Jenkins server.
However, you could alternatively use the
[Page Markup](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Page+Markup+Plugin)
or
[Simple Theme](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Simple+Theme+Plugin)
plugin to support custom CSS and JavaScript as well.

## Getting started

Once you have GreaseMonkey, you can install this script from
[userscripts.org/scripts/show/288354](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/288354).
